; Exercise 1.33:
; Write an even more general version of accumulate called filtered-accumulate.
; Show how to express:
; a) the sum of the squares of the prime numbers between a and b (assuming you
;    have a prime? predicate already written.
; b) the product of all the positive integers less than n that are relatively
;    prime to n (i.e., all positive integers i < n such that GCD(i, n) = 1).
