# Moriturus te saluto.
This repository contains my solutions (aka _spells_) to the exercises proposed
in the Wizard Book (_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition_).

It'll probably take some time until I finish reading it, though.

obs: all the exercises listed in the memento files are the ones I didn't understand well enough or that are in need of revision.
     They have provisory solutions taken from someone else until I write mine.
